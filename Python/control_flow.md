# Control Flow


- Dictates where the code will run
- In programming this is done with if functions and while loops

## if Functions

- Work with Booleans
- Usually used with comparison operators to equate and compare objects, and result in True of False


Syntax

- Indentation is important!

```Python
if <condition True>:
    <do this>
else:
    <do this>
```
