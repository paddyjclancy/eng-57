# Functions

Like people at work. They have ONE job. This makes them simpler and easier to test.

### How do they work?

1) Define
2) Call
3) Run (indented)

Other functionality:
- They can take in arguments to be dynamic morph of output
- If variable is like a box, you name it and place things inside. The box does not interact with your things.
- A function is like a machine, it takes inputs and follows a set of instructions

##### Why functions?

It keeps code DRY. Allows us to call said function to do the actions in the block.

#### Best practices

- Naming convention is same to that of variables, lower_case_underscore()
- It does one job only
- Don't print() within funcition...... return
- Separation of Concerns - Network and infrastructure AND code level
    - Splits into units
    - More maintainable

### Basis of Testing

- Tests have known / controlled input, and expect specific output.
- An assertion

- Unit testing is that of one specific function
- Provides either True or False
