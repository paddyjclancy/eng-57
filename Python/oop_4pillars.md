# Object-Orientated Programming: 4 Pillars

## Abstraction

- Showing only essential features of an object to the outside world.
- Other data contained within objects (Encapsulation)
- Easier interpretation
- TV example:
  - To open your TV we only have a power button
  - It is not required to understand how infra-red waves are getting generated in TV remote control

## Encapsulation

- Accumulating similar data / methods together into single object - Class
- Assists organisation and interpretation
- Provides security, pairs well with Abstraction

## Inheritance

- The concept of being able to create new classes FROM existing classes, ie subclass
- Subclasses have all the functionality of parent classes
- Improves dev efficiency

## Polymorphism

- Subclasses are free to create their own additional behaviours even though being already defined
- Subclass += Class
- Class != Subclass
                        "To take many forms"
